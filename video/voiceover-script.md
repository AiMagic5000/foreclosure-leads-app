# Asset Recovery Leads - Explainer Video Script

## Total Duration: 90 seconds

---

## Scene 1: Intro (0:00 - 0:05)
**Visual:** Logo animation, title text fading in

**Voiceover:**
> "Asset recovery made simple. Fresh foreclosure leads, delivered daily."

---

## Scene 2: Fresh Leads (0:05 - 0:25)
**Visual:** Database icon with data flowing in, map of US states lighting up

**Voiceover:**
> "Every day, thousands of properties go through foreclosure across America. And here's what most people don't know — when a property sells for more than what's owed, that extra money, called surplus funds, legally belongs to the former owner.

> Our system scrapes county recorders, public trustees, and auction sites across all 50 states — automatically pulling fresh leads into your dashboard every single day. Tax deeds. Mortgage surplus. Sheriff sales. We find them all."

---

## Scene 3: Automated Outreach (0:25 - 0:45)
**Visual:** Phone with sound waves, voicemail animation, skip trace data appearing

**Voiceover:**
> "But leads alone aren't enough. You need contact information. That's why every lead is automatically skip-traced — we find phone numbers, emails, and mailing addresses.

> Then, our AI generates personalized voicemails for each property owner. Messages like: 'Hi, this is about the surplus funds from your property at 123 Main Street.' These voicemails are delivered automatically through ringless voicemail, so you can reach hundreds of people while you sleep."

---

## Scene 4: Conversions (0:45 - 1:05)
**Visual:** Bar chart growing, callback notifications, contract signing animation

**Voiceover:**
> "When property owners hear they're owed money, they call back. And that's when deals happen.

> Track every callback, every contract, every commission in your real-time dashboard. Our users see callback rates around 23 percent. Average recovery amounts over $12,000. And your fee? Industry standard is 20 to 30 percent of what you recover."

---

## Scene 5: Success (1:05 - 1:20)
**Visual:** Dollar signs, happy families, money animation

**Voiceover:**
> "This isn't just about making money. Surplus funds rightfully belong to former property owners — families who often have no idea the money exists.

> You become the hero who connects them with funds they didn't know they had. And you earn a substantial fee for your service. It's a win-win."
